NaNoGenMo-Basic
===============

My 2014 NaNoGenMo script and text as I'm working on them and then archived afterwards.

National Novel Generation Month.

Script(s) to automatically generate a 50,000-word "novel" during November, instead of sitting down and writing it. Based on an idea by Github user dariusk co-ordinated.

I'm probably going to do this in an old version BASIC, using ChipmunkBasic on Mac.

Starting out using code by David Ahl from his classic 1979(?) book BASIC Computer Games, with a program called POETRY.
